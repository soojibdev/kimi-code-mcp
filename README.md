MCP server that connects [Kimi Code](https://www.kimi.com/code) (K2.5, 256K context) with [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) — letting Claude orchestrate while Kimi handles the heavy reading.

> [!TIP]
> **Stop paying Claude to read files.** Kimi K2.5 delivers frontier-class code intelligence at a fraction of the cost (see chart above). Delegate bulk codebase scanning to Kimi (256K context, near-zero cost) and let Claude focus on what it does best — reasoning, decisions, and precise code edits. One `kimi_analyze` call can replace 50+ file reads.

## What is Kimi Code?

[**Kimi Code**](https://www.kimi.com/code/en) is an AI code agent by Moonshot AI, powered by the **Kimi K2.5** model (1T MoE, 256K context). It works across Terminal, IDE, and CLI — writing, debugging, refactoring, and analyzing code autonomously.

Key specs:
- **256K token context** — reads entire codebases in one pass
- **Parallel agent spawning** — handles concurrent tasks
- **Shell, file, and web access** — full developer toolchain
- **Install**: `curl -L code.kimi.com/install.sh | bash`

> [!WARNING]
> **Kimi Code membership required.** This MCP server calls the Kimi CLI under the hood, which requires an active [Kimi Code plan](https://www.kimi.com/code/en). Make sure you have a valid subscription and have run `kimi login` before use.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install Kimi CLI
uv tool install kimi-cli && kimi login

# 2. Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/howardpen9/kimi-code-mcp.git
cd kimi-code-mcp && npm install && npm run build
```

Add to `.mcp.json` (project-level or `~/.claude/mcp.json` for global):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kimi-code": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/kimi-code-mcp/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Run `/mcp` in Claude Code to verify — you should see `kimi-code` with 4 tools.

## What You Can Do

Just tell Claude what you need. It will delegate to Kimi automatically:

| Prompt | What happens |
|--------|-------------|
| "Analyze this codebase's architecture" | Kimi reads all files (256K ctx), Claude acts on the report |
| "Scan for security vulnerabilities, then review Kimi's findings" | Kimi audits, Claude cross-examines — AI pair review |
| "Map all dependencies of the auth module, then plan the refactoring" | Kimi builds the dependency graph, Claude plans the changes |
| "Review the recent changes for regressions and edge cases" | Kimi reviews full context (not just the diff), Claude synthesizes |
| "Resume the last Kimi session and ask about the API design" | Kimi retains 256K tokens of context across sessions |

## Why This Exists

Claude Code is powerful but expensive. Every file it reads costs tokens. Meanwhile, many tasks — pre-reviewing large codebases, scanning for patterns, generating audit reports — are **high-certainty work** that doesn't need Claude's full reasoning power.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The cost equation:** Claude reads 50 files to understand your architecture = expensive. Kimi reads 50 files via `kimi_analyze` = near-zero cost. Claude then acts on Kimi's structured report = minimal tokens. **Total savings: 60-80% fewer Claude tokens on analysis-heavy tasks.**

### How It Saves Tokens

```

1. **Claude** receives your task → decides it needs codebase understanding
2. **Claude** calls `kimi_analyze` via MCP → Kimi reads the entire codebase (256K context, near-zero cost)
3. **Kimi** returns a structured analysis
4. **Claude** acts on the analysis with precise, targeted edits

**Result: Claude only spends tokens on decision-making and code writing, not on reading files.**

### Mutual Code Review with K2.5

Kimi Code is powered by K2.5 — a 1T MoE model designed for deep code comprehension. This enables **AI pair review**:

1. **Kimi pre-reviews** — 256K context means it sees the entire codebase at once: security issues, anti-patterns, dead code, architectural problems
2. **Claude cross-examines** — reviews Kimi's findings, challenges questionable items, adds its own insights
3. **Two perspectives** — different models catch different things. What one misses, the other finds

## Use Kimi as a Code Reviewer

Beyond ad-hoc analysis, you can use Kimi as a **dedicated reviewer** in your workflow:

### PR Review Workflow

```
┌──────────────┐   diff    ┌──────────────┐  structured  ┌──────────────┐
│   Your PR    │ ────────► │  Kimi Code   │  findings    │  Claude Code │
│  (changes)   │           │  (reviewer)  │ ────────────►│  (decision)  │
└──────────────┘           └──────────────┘              └──────────────┘
```

### Continuous Audit Pattern

| When | What | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| Before merging | Kimi scans diff + affected modules | Catch regressions early |
| Weekly | Full codebase sweep | Accumulated tech debt |
| Pre-release | Security-focused audit | Ship with confidence |

Each review session can be **resumed** (`kimi_resume`) — Kimi retains up to 256K tokens of context from previous sessions, building understanding over time.

### What Kimi Reviews Well

| Review Type | Why Kimi Excels |
|-------------|----------------|
| Security audit | 256K context sees full attack surface, not just isolated files |
| Dead code detection | Can trace imports/exports across entire codebase |
| API consistency | Compares patterns across all endpoints simultaneously |
| Dependency analysis | Maps full dependency graph in one pass |
| Architecture review | Sees the forest and the trees at the same time |

## Tools

| Tool | Description | Timeout |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `kimi_analyze` | Deep codebase analysis (architecture, audit, refactoring) | 10 min |
| `kimi_query` | Quick programming questions, no codebase context | 2 min |
| `kimi_list_sessions` | List existing Kimi sessions with metadata | instant |
| `kimi_resume` | Resume a previous session (up to 256K token context) | 10 min |

## How It Works

```
┌──────────────┐  stdio/MCP   ┌──────────────┐  subprocess   ┌──────────────┐
│  Claude Code │ ◄──────────► │ kimi-code-mcp│ ────────────► │ Kimi CLI     │
│  (conductor) │              │ (MCP server) │               │ (K2.5, 256K) │
└──────────────┘              └──────────────┘               └──────────────┘
```

1. Claude Code calls an MCP tool (e.g., `kimi_analyze`)
2. This server spawns the `kimi` CLI with the prompt and codebase path
3. Kimi autonomously reads files, analyzes the code (up to 256K tokens)
4. The result is parsed from Kimi's JSON output and returned to Claude Code
5. Claude acts on the structured results — edits, plans, or further analysis

## Advanced Setup

For development (auto-recompile on changes):

    "kimi-code": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["tsx", "/absolute/path/to/kimi-code-mcp/src/index.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```
